To connect to VM you can use ssh protocol with the use of your terminal.
ssh [computername]@[VM ip]
ssh imfilip@20.111.18.87

Enter the password you provided creating your VM.

First thing you should do after your VM is created is to update information of available apps (e.g. if there are latest version of apps you have installed) for Ubuntu and then upgrade all apps installed on your VM.
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

-y - ensures all prompts will be passed with acceptance

Check if python is installed:
python --version
python3 --version

If not, install it:
sudo apt install python3

Check if pip is installed:
pip --version
pip3 --version

If not, install it:
sudo apt install python3-pip

Install virtualenv python package:
sudo pip3 install virtualenv

Install postgresql:
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib -y


You can check if postgresql server is running on your machine:
ps -ef | grep postgres

or

sudo systemctl status postgresql

ps - list all active processes

Or:
pg_lsclusters 
This command show information about all PostgreSQL clusters

List of all packages installed on tour VM contain postgres in name:
dpkg -l | grep postgres

If something is wrong you can uninstall all packages related to postresql:
sudo apt-get --purge remove postgresql postgresql-*

Delete all folders:
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/postgresql/
sudo rm -rf /var/log/postgresql/
sudo rm -rf /etc/postgresql/

Delete postgres user:
sudo deluser postgres

List of all users of your VM:
sudo cat /etc/passwd

You can try to switch to postgres user:
su - postgres

In my case prompt occurs to provide password to this user (on the tutorial there was that requirements).
Thi is due to the fact that Azure VM does not provide you with the access to root user. In order to change user to postgres using su, you have to know root password.
There is another way. This one worked:
sudo -u postgres psql postgres


Now you can change the password for postgres user:
\password postgres
